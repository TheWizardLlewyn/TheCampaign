How do you play?

1) Scenarios - you get a situation and make a choice and the outcome affects your stats and such.
 -- Debates
Example:
You're a reporter and find bad news about your party.  If you lie, you lose followers, but keep integrity and get more stories in the future...

2) Events - Events you control, they cost money, turns, etc, you define how you want them to be set up and then your skills define how effective.  They are minigames.
